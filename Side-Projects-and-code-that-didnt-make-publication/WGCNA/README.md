This analysis reduces dimensions in the data to create modules and looks at the gene ontology of DNAm assocaited with each module. 

There are some good resources on this analysis online. Particularly this youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7xoX3-7ZtY) is Steve Horvath explaining the method and it's uses.
