Differential Methylation in Partially Methylated Domains in PE and IUGR

This is a current side project looking at whether placental specific partially methylated domains (PMDs) are differentially methylated in Preeclampsia (PE), divided into early-onset PE (EOPE), and late-onset PE (LOPE) and/or Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). 
Probes on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array that were located in PMDs from Schroeder et al (2013) were isolated. PMDs were only considered represented on the array if 3 or more probes were within the PMD.

Linear regression correcting for fetal sex was run. EOPE was compared to pre-term controls with similar gestational age range, LOPE and IUGR were compared to term controls with similar age ranges. 

No PMDs were differentially methylated in LOPE or IUGR. 29 were differentially methylated in EOPE compared to pre-term controls.
