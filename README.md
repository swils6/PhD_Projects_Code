**Placental-Telomere-Length-Project**

**Abstract**

INTRODUCTION:
Telomere length (TL) has been suggested to be influenced by inherited genetic and epigenetic variation, hormonal effects, oxidative stress and age. However, the dynamics of TL during in utero development have not been well explored. This study investigates the relationship between placental TL and sex, gestational age (GA), and DNA methylation (DNAm). Placental TL is further evaluated in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), conditions hypothesized to lead to decreased placental TL due to increased oxidative stress.

METHODS:
Average TL in 21 early-onset PE (EOPE), 18 late-onset PE (LOPE), 9 IUGR, 59 viable and 33 non-viable control placentas were measured by qPCR. Of these, 13 control, 20 EOPE, 17 LOPE, and 8 IUGR samples were also run on the Illumina 450K array. ANOVA was used to compare TL between controls and EOPE, LOPE, and IUGR. Linear regression correcting for GA and sex, assessed the association between TL and DNAm in biologically-relevant genes (TERC, TERT, DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b), and array-wide.

RESULTS:
Male sex and increasing GA were associated with shorter placental TL. Correcting for these factors, no significant difference in TL was observed between EOPE, LOPE, and IUGR placentas compared to controls. Targeted analysis revealed TL was associated with DNAm at TERT, DNMT1, and DNMT3a. An array-wide approach found no additional sites associated with TL.
CONCLUSION:
Variability in placental TL is associated with alterations in DNAm at TERT, DNMT1, and DNMT3a. Placental TL is not strongly influenced by EOPE, LOPE, or IUGR.

**Abstract**

Placental health is a key component to healthy pregnancy. Placental insufficiency (PI), inadequate nutrient delivery to the fetus, is associated with preeclampsia (PE), a maternal hypertensive disorder, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), pathologically poor fetal growth. PI is more common in early-onset PE (EOPE) than late-onset PE (LOPE). However, the relationship between these disorders remains unclear. While DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been identified in PE and IUGR, these entities can overlap and few studies have analyzed these separately. This study aims to identify altered DNAm in EOPE, LOPE, and normotensive IUGR, validate these alterations, and use them to better understand the relationships between these related disorders. Placental samples from a discovery cohort (43 controls, 22 EOPE, 18 LOPE, 11 IUGR) and validation cohort (15 controls, 22 EOPE, 11 LOPE) were evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. To minimize gestational age (GA) effects, EOPE samples were compared to pre-term controls (GA <37 weeks), while LOPE and IUGR were compared to term controls (GA >37 weeks). There were 1703 differentially methylated (DM) sites (FDR<0.05, ∆β>0.1) in EOPE, 5 in LOPE, and 0 in IUGR. Of the 1703 EOPE sites, 599 were validated in the second cohort. These sites cluster samples from both cohorts into 3 distinct methylation clusters. Interestingly, LOPE samples diagnosed between 34-36 weeks with co-occurring IUGR clustered with the EOPE methylation cluster. DNAm profiling may provide an independent tool to refine clinical diagnoses into subgroups with more uniform pathology. The challenges in reproducing genome-wide DNAm studies are also discussed.
