# General_Functions_And_Code

**PMD Function:** This function will pull all the probes on the 450K array (Will also work for EPIC Data as well) that located within placental partially methylated domains (PMDs) defined by Schroeder et al (2013).

**Random Sampling Function:** This function will resample the number of hits identified in the discovery cohort, and run a linear model on those hits. I subsequently ask for this to be run 1000 times and ask whether the amount of hits that validated by chance in 1000 iterations is significantly different than the number of hits that validated within our data.
